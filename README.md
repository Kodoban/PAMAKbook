# PAMAKbook
 A simulated rudimentary social network for university students. Users can send and accept friend requests, post on their friends' profiles, and join groups. Users are also notified when a first or second degree contact (friend or friend of a friend, respectively) gets the flu.

# Important heads-up
This is the final version of the project for a Java course assignment. It's been a while since I last checked the code, so it might not be optimized, but nevertheless works exactly like it's intended. Comments are also in Greek. I will get to updating the code and translating any comments to English in the near future.
